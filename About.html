					<p>I have worked in research since 2008.
                            As such, I am prone to validating and operationalizing data into applicable reporting.
                            Many of the Api’s originally discovered had confusing and complex metrics which would have been difficult to apply for an end user, much less to program.
                            After researching some about the Animal Services, Department of Justice, and Drug Interactions api’s,
                            I quickly agreed to use what seemed like a very useful Api in the National Parks Service.
                            The former Api’s were either convoluted, or in PDF format tables which would not have fulfilled the requirement.
                            The National Parks Service api however had many query options, with useful output that we could work with.
                            Alex and Nilanjan’s familiarity with calling api’s made any further parsing and filtering of the queries more manageable. After
                            deciding on a concept I have formated the about page and home page. </p>
